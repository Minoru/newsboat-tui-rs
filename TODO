- implement a simple command line with ":quit" command
- implement sample itemview with enough text to demonstrate scrolling
- demonstrate running an interactive command (`mc`?) (requires switching to-fro
  alternate screen)
- implement switching between dialogs
- look through ~/src/newsboat/TODO_global for other things that I might wish to
  try and implement here


Unimplementable:
- implement highlighting keywords in itemlist -- https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/issues/118
