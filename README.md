This is a mockup of [Newsboat][newsboat]'s UI, redone with [tui-rs][tui-rs]. The
goal is to evaluate tui-rs as a replacement for [STFL][stfl] (see
[newsboat/newsboat#232][issue-232]).

NOTES in the root of the repo contains, well, notes: things I learned during
that exercise that I'd like to remember.
