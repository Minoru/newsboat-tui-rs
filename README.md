This is a mockup of [Newsboat][newsboat]'s UI, redone with [tui-rs][tui-rs]. The
goal is to evaluate tui-rs as a replacement for [STFL][stfl] (see
[newsboat/newsboat#232][issue-232]).

TODO in the root of the repo contains a list of things I'd like to recreate with
tui-rs before declaring it Newsboat's new UI library.
