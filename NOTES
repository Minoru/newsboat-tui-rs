Hard:
- the API actively discourages storing `Text` values and anything that derives
  from them, e.g. `Paragraph`. (It's discouraged by references; I couldn't
  figure out a way to store this stuff in a struct.) `Text` and `Paragraph`
  have to be rebuilt before displaying a frame. I'm ok with rebuilding
  `Paragraph`, since it's relatively lightweight thing. `Text`, on the other
  hand, should contain formatting (although it can't properly in tui-rs);
  re-formatting the whole article on each repaint is... wrong.

Unimplementable:
- implement highlighting keywords in itemlist -- https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/issues/118
    - see if I can get around this my implementing my own list widget
